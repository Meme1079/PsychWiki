# Psych-Wiki
> **Note**: This is not the official wiki of Psych Engine

Welcome to PsychWiki! This is where we dedicate to documenting functions/other that is or not in official wiki with high quality descriptions and researching. This repository was made because the official wiki hasn't been updated for a while, so I decided to make my own wiki cuz why the hell not?

### Current Update [14.1.0 Version]
- Added "Custom Substate" Page
- Added new 0.7.2 functions
- Some orginizations from the wiki pages

### Previous Update [14.0.0 Version]
- Added some additional context on descriptions
- Added descriptions to `createInstance()` and `addInstance()` functions
- Added new names for some function & variable for newer versions
- Added Pre-imported Libraries for references in "HScript Functions" Page
- Added missing variables and functions
- Revamp "Basics of Coding", "Global Functions & Variables", "Library Methods", and "String Patterns" Page
- Fix spelling/grammar errors.

### Previous Update [13.1.0 Version]
- Added the new `onEventPushed()` callback function, that's it.
